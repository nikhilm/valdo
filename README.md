Valdo
=====

Valdo is a simple task manager based on the [Backbone.js](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone)
It is based on the code by [Jérôme Gravel-Niquet](http://jgn.me), but stores the actual
data in [OpenKeyVal](http://openkeyval.org) instead of HTML5 LocalStorage.

This makes for a portable, pure javascript Todo list manager.

It is not meant to be very useful, it was just a hack to learn about Backbone.

You should choose a relatively unique username otherwise you will be able to
see and overwrite other people's tasks :)
